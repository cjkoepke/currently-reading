# Currently Reading
An application to track reading progress and status in a local environment. I built this from scratch, including hierarchy, styling, and composition.

The project uses a mock API to handle book request, retrieved from the source [Udacity repository](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/blob/master/src/BooksAPI.js).

## Starting the Env
To start the project, first clone this repository to your computer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cjkoepke/currently-reading.git
```

Either using NPM or Yarn (I prefer the Yarn interface - see below), run the following commands in order:

**NPM:**
```bash
npm install
```
```bash
npm run start
```

**Yarn:**
```bash
yarn install
```
```bash
yarn start
```

## Dependencies
This project requires both Node and either NPM or Yarn to be installed.
