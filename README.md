# Currently Reading
An application to track reading progress and status in a local environment. I built this without a template, using my own hierarchy, styling, and composition. I figured this would be a better way to learn.

It does, however, use the `create-react-app` project by Facebook for setup and bundling.

The project uses a mock API to handle book request, retrieved from the [Udacity repository](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/blob/master/src/BooksAPI.js) for the class.

## Starting the Env
To start the project, first clone this repository to your computer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cjkoepke/currently-reading.git
```

Navigate to the `currently-reading` folder. Using either NPM or Yarn (I prefer the Yarn interface - see below), run the following commands:

**NPM:**
```bash
npm install && npm run start
```

**Yarn:**
```bash
yarn install && yarn start
```

## Dependencies
This project requires both Node and either NPM or Yarn to be installed.
- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
